#maddyhud
##about
A pretty simple TF2 hud that moves the health/ammo for readability as well as some of the meters for things like Demo's charge.

##why should I use this
###pros
* repositioned health, ammo, meters for readability
* very similar to the stock hud
* doesn't need to be updated as much since it does not affect all the files

###cons
* doesn't look as pretty
* definitely NOT finished, (things literally do not work)
* creator really doesn't know what he's doing (if someone knows how to change the color of the meters please contact me)

## how to install
Drag and drop the "maddyhud" folder in your "custom" folder 

Default location for custom folder:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\%accountame%\team fortress 2\tf\custom
```

## bugs
* meters should be a nice light tan to match with health/ammo
* meters such as soda popper and bonk/crit-a-cola are not yet implemented
