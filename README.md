#maddyhud
##about
A pretty simple TF2 hud that moves the health/ammo for readability as well as some of the meters for things like Demo's charge.

##why should I use this
###PROS
* repositioned health, ammo, meters for readability
* very similar to the stock hud
* doesn't need to be updated as much since it does not affect all the files

###CONS
* doesn't look as pretty
* definitely NOT finished, (things literally do not work)
* creator really doesn't know what he's doing (if someone knows how to change the color of the meters please contact me)
